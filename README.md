<h1>ABOUT PROJECT</h1>
This project is intended to develop an understanding of different machine learning algorithms and techniques.
I am implementing the algorithms and building the models from scratch without
the use of machine learning libraries (Tensorflow, Keras, SciKit, etc.)

This is not intended to build the best, most accurate, or most efficient models
but rather simplify and explain the workings behind different supervised learning algorithms commonly used in machine learning.

The problem being used to train and test these models is the common problem of
classifying hand written digits and predicting what they are. The data used
is the MNIST dataset.
